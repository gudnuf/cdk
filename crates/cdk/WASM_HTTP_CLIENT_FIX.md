# WASM HTTP Client Compatibility Fix

## Problem Summary

The CDK HTTP client was experiencing panics when compiled for WASM targets due to the use of `std::time::Instant::now()` in the `retriable_http_request` method. The error manifested as:

```
RuntimeError: unreachable
    at my_wasm_lib.wasm.__rust_start_panic
    at std::time::Instant::now::h0b702be0680b3ec2
    at cdk::wallet::mint_connector::http_client::HttpClient::retriable_http_request
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred in `crates/cdk/src/wallet/mint_connector/http_client.rs` at line 245:

```rust
let started = Instant::now(); // ‚ùå Not available in WASM
```

`std::time::Instant::now()` is not available in WebAssembly environments because WASM doesn't have access to high-precision system timing functions.

## Solution

### 1. Use instant Crate for Cross-Platform Timing

Replaced the custom timing utility with the well-maintained `instant` crate that:
- Uses `std::time::Instant` on native targets
- Uses appropriate web APIs on WASM targets (with `wasm-bindgen` feature)
- Provides a drop-in replacement for `std::time::Instant`

### 2. Updated Dependencies

Added the `instant` crate to `crates/cdk/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
instant = { workspace = true, features = ["wasm-bindgen", "inaccurate"] }
```

### 3. Updated HTTP Client

Modified `crates/cdk/src/wallet/mint_connector/http_client.rs` to use the instant crate:

```rust
// Before:
use std::time::{Duration, Instant}; // ‚ùå Instant::now() panics in WASM
let started = Instant::now();

// After:
use instant::Instant; // ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatible
let started = Instant::now();
```

### 3. Created WASM Tests

Created comprehensive WASM-specific tests in `crates/cdk/tests/wasm_http_client_test.rs` that:
- Test HTTP client creation in WASM environments
- Test retriable HTTP requests that previously caused panics
- Test the timing utility directly
- Include browser-based test harness in `crates/cdk/tests/wasm_test.html`

## Files Modified

1. **Core Fix:**
   - `crates/cdk/Cargo.toml` (added instant crate dependency)
   - `crates/cdk/src/wallet/mint_connector/http_client.rs` (updated to use instant::Instant)

2. **Tests and Examples:**
   - `crates/cdk/tests/wasm_http_client_test.rs` (updated to use instant::Instant)
   - `crates/cdk/tests/wasm_test.html` (browser test harness)
   - `crates/cdk/examples/test_wasm_timing.rs` (updated to use instant::Instant)
   - `crates/cdk/test_wasm.sh` (WASM compatibility test script)

## Verification

The fix has been verified to:

‚úÖ **Compile successfully for WASM target:**
```bash
export NIX_HARDENING_ENABLE=""
export CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown=/usr/bin/clang
cargo check -p cdk --no-default-features --features wallet --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

‚úÖ **Work correctly on native targets:**
```bash
cargo run --example test_wasm_timing --features "wallet"
# Output: üéâ All timing tests passed!
```

‚úÖ **Maintain API compatibility:** The change is internal and doesn't affect the public HTTP client API.

## Usage

After this fix, the HTTP client should work correctly in WASM environments without panicking on timing operations. The retriable request functionality will continue to work as expected, using JavaScript's Date API for timing in browsers.

## Testing the Fix

### Native Testing
```bash
cargo run --example test_wasm_timing --features "wallet"
```

### WASM Testing (requires wasm-pack)
```bash
cd crates/cdk
./test_wasm.sh
```

Then open `crates/cdk/tests/wasm_test.html` in a web browser to run interactive tests.

## Technical Details

- **instant Crate:** Well-maintained library specifically designed for cross-platform timing
- **Native Implementation:** Uses `std::time::Instant` for high-precision timing
- **WASM Implementation:** Uses appropriate browser APIs with the `wasm-bindgen` feature
- **Features:** The `inaccurate` feature provides fallbacks for limited timing environments
- **Performance:** Minimal overhead, optimized for both platforms
- **Compatibility:** Works with all major browsers and WASM runtimes

## Next Steps

This fix resolves the immediate `std::time::Instant::now()` panic issue. Future enhancements could include:

1. More comprehensive WASM integration tests with actual HTTP servers
2. Better error handling for network issues in WASM environments
3. Integration with browser-specific timing APIs for higher precision if needed
